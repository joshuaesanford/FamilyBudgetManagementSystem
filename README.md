# Project Title: Family Budget Management System

## 1. Overview:

### The Family Budget Management System is a software application that aims to offer a comprehensive budgeting solution for households. It will be implemented using Java and Batch Scripting. This tool will allow users to track their income, expenses, savings, and investments. It will also provide useful insights and analytics to help users make informed financial decisions.

## 2. Functional Requirements:

### 2.1 Budget Tracking:

#### The application should allow users to input their income and expenses, categorizing them into different types (for example: food, utilities, rent/mortgage, transportation, etc.) and track them over time.

### 2.2 Expense Analysis:

#### The tool should provide a breakdown of expenses in the form of charts or graphs, to highlight the areas where the most money is being spent.

### 2.3 Income Analysis:

#### Display the income sources and the amount contributed by each source in a given period.

### 2.4 Savings and Investment Tracking:

#### The tool should allow users to input their savings and investment information and track the growth over time.

### 2.5 Alerts and Reminders:

#### The system should send alerts when the expenses are nearing the budget limit. It should also remind users of upcoming bills or payments.

### 2.6 Reports:

#### The system should allow users to generate detailed financial reports for a selected time period.

### 2.7 User Management:

#### The system should support multiple users, each with their own separate budget profiles.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements:

### 3.1 Security:

#### The application should have a secure login system to ensure the privacy of the user's financial information. 

### 3.2 Usability:

#### The system should be user-friendly with an intuitive interface.

### 3.3 Performance:

#### The system should perform tasks and generate reports quickly and accurately.

### 3.4 Portability:

#### The system should be able to run on different operating systems.

## 4. Technology Stack:

### 4.1 Java:

#### The main application will be written in Java due to its robustness, ease of use, and cross-platform capabilities.

### 4.2 Batch Scripting:

#### Batch scripting will be used for task automation, managing the database, and handling routine tasks.

### 4.3 Database:

#### A robust database system (like MySQL or SQLite) will be used to store user data.

## 5. Deliverables:

### - Source code of the application
### - Detailed user manual
### - Technical documentation
### - Test reports
